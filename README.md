A working website Title. The title should be short, catchy and would encapsulate what the website is about.

A short but comprehensive description of the website using only one or two paragraphs

An outline of the website of at least 5 web pages with short descriptions.  The website should have a clear home page. Do note that only the homepage + two other web pages will be submitted this 1st Qtr.

An initial wireframe for the homepage and the two web pages, showing clearly the layout, position of contents, both text and images and the navigation between the three web pages.  The wireframe should also clearly show the web pages’ actual titles, web page section headers and actual link (navigation) names.

Could be written on a pad paper/graphing paper or saved in a file named as SectionLastName - 1stQtrProposal.pdf (example: RbMendoza – 1stQtrProposal.pdf.

Project Proposal should also be included in your Github project repository's README.MD.  

Upload your pdf file here or a link to your Github account repository which contains the project proposal in the readme.md.
