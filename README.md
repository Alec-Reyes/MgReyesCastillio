## Description:
Welcome to SimplyCube, a beginners guide to solving a Rubik's Cube. This website features the basics of cubing, followed by an easy-to follow tutorial. Once you're ready to take the next level, you can learn about the CFOP method, a more advanced but faster method of solving a Rubik's cube. Not much of a reader? Try our interactive cubing visual software!
